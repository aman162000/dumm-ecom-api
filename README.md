A Dummy API is useful during development and testing when live data is either unavailable or unreliable. As someone who wants to practise developing e-commerce websites, it might be hard to find any dummy data to use as a placeholder throughout the development phase. Some e-commerce platform provide Apis but, these APIs are complex in implementation and includes Authorization.
