![Made With](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Django-68A063?style=for-the-badge&logo=Django)

A Dummy API is useful during development and testing when live data is either unavailable or unreliable. As someone who wants to practise developing e-commerce websites, it might be hard to find any dummy data to use as a placeholder throughout the development phase. Some e-commerce platform provide Apis but, these APIs are complex in implementation and includes Authorization.
